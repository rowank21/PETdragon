Main Page Graphics:
Upon entering the main page, you're greeted with a charming scene of your dragon's habitat. The background features a cozy cave adorned with shimmering green crystals and  
parts of the cave sticking out to give it a bit of a spooky appeal, perfect for those who love dragons. The ambient lighting casts a warm glow, creating a comforting environment for your dragon to thrive.
The main page graphics strike a perfect balance between whimsical charm and serene beauty, making it a delight to interact with your dragon.

Progress Bars:
The heart of DragonCompanion lies in its intuitive progress bars, which serve as vital indicators of your dragon's well-being. 
Three progress bars – health, hunger, and mood – are prominently displayed on the main page, allowing you to monitor your dragon's status at a glance. Each bar dynamically adjusts based on your dragon's needs, providing real-time feedback on its condition.

The health bar reflects your dragon's overall well-being, indicating any injuries or illnesses that require attention. Keep an eye on this bar to ensure your dragon stays in peak condition.

The hunger bar measures your dragon's appetite, reminding you to feed it regularly. Neglecting this bar can lead to hunger and eventually your dragon perishing.

The alive bar gauges your dragon's emotional state, ranging from contentment to distress. Engage in activities that bring joy to your dragon to keep its mood bar high such as feeding it or playing chess with it.

Failure to maintain these progress bars can have dire consequences for your dragon. Letting the health bar deplete too much can result in illness or even death.
Similarly, neglecting the hunger and mood bars can lead to a sad and lethargic dragon. It's crucial to prioritize your dragon's needs and ensure all progress bars remain filled to keep your companion happy and healthy.

Problems i ran into when creating this app:
firstly the intent page was very satisfying to do as i got it from the module manual but i found a simpler and faster way on youtube with using a manifest xml activity 
secondly the buttons were very hard to keep in place with each other aswell as the imageview and the progress bars even with all the help of the constraint layout features.

Conclusion:
Dragonkeep offers a captivating and immersive experience for dragon enthusiasts of all ages. With its stunning graphics, engaging interactions, and intuitive progress bars, DragonCompanion provides hours of entertainment and companionship. 
Download Dragonkeep today and embark on an unforgettable journey with your very own virtual pet dragon!
